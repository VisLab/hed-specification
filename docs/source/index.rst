Specification role
******************

The HED specification document formalizes the syntax and behavior of
HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) vocabulary, annotations, and supporting tools. The specification supports three versions of the specification:

- `develop <https://hed-specification.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html>`_ - development branch which is under discussion.
- `latest <https://hed-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ - includes revisions approved by the HED Working Group but not released.
- `stable <https://hed-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ - the latest released form.

For more information about HED see `The HED project homepage <https://www.hedtags.org>`_ and
the `HED resources page <https://www.hed-resources.org>`_.
